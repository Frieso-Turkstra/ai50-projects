        <!--Das Nachtlied-->
        <div class="poem">
        <h1>Das Nachtlied</h1>
        <h2>By Friedrich Nietzsche, 1883</h2>
            <p>'Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also is a gushing fountain<br />
            'Tis night: now only do all songs of the loving ones awake. And my soul also is the song of a loving one</p>

            <p>Something unappeased, unappeasable, is within me; it longeth to find expression. A craving for love is within me, which speaketh itself the language of love<br />
            Light am I: ah, that I were night! But it is my lonesomeness to be begirt with light!</p>

            <p>Ah, that I were dark and nightly! How would I suck at the breasts of light!<br />
            And you yourselves would I bless, ye twinkling starlets and glow-worms aloft!—and would rejoice in the gifts of your light</p>

            <p>But I live in mine own light, I drink again into myself the flames that break forth from me<br />
            I know not the happiness of the receiver; and oft have I dreamt that stealing must be more blessed than receiving</p>

            <p>It is my poverty that my hand never ceaseth bestowing; it is mine envy that I see waiting eyes and the brightened nights of longing<br />
            Oh, the misery of all bestowers! Oh, the darkening of my sun! Oh, the craving to crave! Oh, the violent hunger in satiety!</p>

            <p>They take from me: but do I yet touch their soul? There is a gap 'twixt giving and receiving; and the smallest gap hath finally to be bridged over<br />
            A hunger ariseth out of my beauty: I should like to injure those I illumine; I should like to rob those I have gifted:—thus do I hunger for wickedness</p>

            <p>Withdrawing my hand when another hand already stretcheth out to it; hesitating like the cascade, which hesitateth even in its leap:—thus do I hunger for wickedness!<br />
            Such revenge doth mine abundance think of: such mischief welleth out of my lonesomeness</p>

            <p>My happiness in bestowing died in bestowing; my virtue became weary of itself by its abundance!<br />
            He who ever bestoweth is in danger of losing his shame; to him who ever dispenseth, the hand and heart become callous by very dispensing</p>

            <p>Mine eye no longer overfloweth for the shame of suppliants; my hand hath become too hard for the trembling of filled hands<br />
            Whence have gone the tears of mine eye, and the down of my heart? Oh, the lonesomeness of all bestowers! Oh, the silence of all shining ones!</p>

            <p>Many suns circle in desert space: to all that is dark do they speak with their light—but to me they are silent<br />
            Oh, this is the hostility of light to the shining one: unpityingly doth it pursue its course</p>

            <p>Unfair to the shining one in its innermost heart, cold to the suns:—thus travelleth every sun<br />
            Like a storm do the suns pursue their courses: that is their travelling. Their inexorable will do they follow: that is their coldness</p>

            <p>Oh, ye only is it, ye dark, nightly ones, that extract warmth from the shining ones! Oh, ye only drink milk and refreshment from the light's udders!<br />
            Ah, there is ice around me; my hand burneth with the iciness! Ah, there is thirst in me; it panteth after your thirst!</p>

            <p>'Tis night: alas, that I have to be light! And thirst for the nightly! And lonesomeness!<br />
            'Tis night: now doth my longing break forth in me as a fountain,—for speech do I long</p>

            <p>'Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also is a gushing fountain<br />
            'Tis night: now do all songs of loving ones awake. And my soul also is the song of a loving one.—</p>
            <p>Thus sang Zarathustra</p>
